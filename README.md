Fox and Hounds is a two player game in which both players take turns moving their piece/pieces diagonally one square. The fox can move forwards or backwards, the hounds only forwards.

The hounds' goal is to trap the fox. The fox's goal is to 'escape' to the end of the board i.e. to land on one of the hounds' starting squares.
